    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About This Project</h1>

    <p class="mb-3">Hey there! Hope you're doing great. I'm <strong>Dipesh Rewar</strong>, and this is one of my full-fledged backend application — and I’m really excited to share it with you.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">I started building this project locally on localhost server using <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express.js</strong>, with <strong>MongoDB</strong> as the database to manage user data and posts securely. I was satisfied with output as everything was perfectly working</p>
    
    <p class="mb-3">At first, I was pretty satisfied running this app on my localhost — felt like a real backend wizard. But then reality hit: you can’t exactly tell your friends that “Hey, come over to my laptop if you want to try my project.” We all know localhost isn’t very social. So naturally, I had to find a way to put it online!</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Then I tried hosting it on GitHub and deploying via <strong>Vercel</strong>. It worked great for frontend, but backend deployment and database connection were a real challenge. Vercel struggled with MongoDB connectivity and real-time server behavior.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-3">Then I discovered <strong>Render</strong> — and it changed everything. It’s fast, reliable, and built to handle real-time backend apps. I was able to deploy my Node server and connect it with <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> easily. It now runs 24/7, from anywhere in the world!</p>
    
    <p class="mb-3">What’s cool about this app:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-5 text-sm">
        <ul class="list-decimal list-inside mb-5 text-sm space-y-1">
            <li>🔐 User registration and login with secure password hashing</li>
            <li>⚡ Real-time server response with JWT authentication</li>
            <li>🌐 Global deployment with MongoDB Atlas as the cloud database</li>
            <li>🎨 Clean UI using EJS and styled with Tailwind CSS</li>
            <li>🚀 Fast and reliable hosting on Render</li>
            <li>🛠 Built with modular code and clear structure</li>
          </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="mb-3">I built this to understand how full-stack apps work in the real world — and I learned a lot from every hurdle.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-3">Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. I truly appreciate your time and attention in exploring this project.</p>
